# PipeWrench (For PZPW)
[![Build](https://github.com/Konijima/pzpw-pipewrench/actions/workflows/Build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Konijima/pzpw-pipewrench/actions/workflows/Build.yml)
PipeWrench is a set of TypeScript definitions for both the Java API and Lua codebase for the game Project Zomboid.

## Advantages
- TypeScript provides type safety where Lua does not. 
- Code with errors will not compile in most TypeScript environments for improper usages of types.
- Writing Lua works with PipeWrench. (Lua Interfaces & separate Lua files)

## Caveats
- TypeScriptToLua Caveats: https://typescripttolua.github.io/docs/caveats
- Lua types are in BETA. 
  - `lua/client/Context` and a couple other design patterns aren't processed so these calls will need their own Lua interfaces built manually.
